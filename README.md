# Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Project 1
This is the first project of the Udacity Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree. This project comes at the end of the 
introduction section so is fairly basic as is expected for the introduction.

## Project Overview
This project contains five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. Python is
used to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, the project requires
a run time analysis of the solution and determine its efficiency.

## Deliverables
Each of the five `task*.py` files contain the code required to answer the required questions along with an explanation
of the code and printouts of the answers.
The [Analysis](Analysis.txt) file also contains the time complexity discussion.
